# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in C++. It's designed for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of DSA concepts and practical applications, especially using C++.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- **Arrays:** Implementation and operations, including sorting, searching, and manipulation techniques.
- **Linked Lists:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular lists, along with common operations.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Array-based and linked list-based implementations, along with applications.
- **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, heaps, and common tree traversals.
- **Graphs:** Representations (adjacency matrix and list), traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), and shortest path algorithms.
- **Hash Tables:** Hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and use cases.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and more.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear search, binary search, and hash-based search techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Common problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and Fibonacci sequence.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Problems like activity selection, fractional knapsack, and more.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), MST (Prim's, Kruskal's), and connected components.
- **Recursion and Backtracking:** N-Queens, subset sum, and other classic problems.
  
### Utilities

- **Math Algorithms:** Prime number generation, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic, and fast exponentiation.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Techniques for efficient computation, including bitwise operations and tricks.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for C++ enthusiasts and those preparing for coding interviews. Each implementation is optimized for clarity and follows best practices in C++ for data structure and algorithm design. Concepts like memory management, pointers, and time-space complexities are applied throughout.
